<p class ="two"><br>The Problem You have to stabilize the conversation or reason with the subject as communication with the subject is very life-threatening and often causes bouts of frustration and headaches. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to meet all the requirements and have immense patience handling the various security measures as the subject is considered extremely insecure and emotional.</p>
<p class ="three">If you succeed in this mission, the whole country may not know the hero that you are, but you will be awarded oreo shakes and pizza, should the subject be satisfied. </p>
<p class ="four">The government can neither deny nor confirm your involvement with this very fragile mission, we wish you the best.This message will self detonate after you have sent your answer<br>
_Good luck_</p>
